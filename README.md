In this read/ project, I learnt:
- To fix react's body whitespace at top of website => add `*{margin; 0}` in parent CSS file
- To pass different types of props from parent to children props
- To set a default value for props if none is passed exclusively
- To pass JSX components as children
- To make a JSX wrapper component passing in the `children` prop
